    <h1>Movie Rankings by Vincent Rivera</h1>
    <h2>Top 4</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Bullet Train</h3>
    <p>They chose a really good cast: the actors made a great job portraying their characters. Gotta love the absurd humour in some scenes too.</p>
    <h3>I Am Legend</h3>
    <p>I mean they have Will Smith, what more do you need for a good movie? Ah yes, zombies and a badass dog.</p>
    <h3>A Quiet Place: Day One</h3>
    <p>I love how they play with sound to create suspense. Some movies are thrilling because of their soundtrack, but this movie proves that some scenes are scarier when its in absolute silence.</p>
    <h3>Deadpool & Wolverine</h3>
    <p>Two of Marvel's superstars. They usually star in their own movies, but both of them in one? C'mon, this one's an easy pick.</p>
