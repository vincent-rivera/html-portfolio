<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Started my creative career with portrait and food photography with a simple, entry-level DSLR camera. From there, I
  learned how to use content editing software such as Photoshop and Premiere Pro.</p>

<p>I started taking it more seriously and enrolled in a Design, Animation and Digital Arts university degree which
  taught many disciplines, such as: 3D modelling, sculpting and texturing, photography, videography, brand design,
  illustration, UX/UI design and many more.</p>

<p>I'm currently learning to cap it all off with a web developing course, hoping to tie all of the technical knowledge
  I'm about to learn with my artistic and more creative abilities for a Front-end or UX/UI career.</p>
